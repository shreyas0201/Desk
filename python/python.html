<h2>Setting Up Python</h2>


<p>This book is about programming computers with Python. You could read this book from cover to cover without <br>ever touching a keyboard, but you’d miss out on the fun part—coding!</p> <br>

<p>To get the most out of this book, you need a computer with <br> Python installed on it and a way to create, edit, and save Python code files.</p><br>

<p ><b>In this chapter, you’ll learn how to:</b></p>

<p>•	Install the latest version of Python 3 on your computer</p><br>
<p>•	Open IDLE, Python’s built-in Integrated Development and
Learning Environment <br>
Let’s get started!</p> <br>








 
	<h3>A Note on Python Versions</h3><br>
<p>Many operating systems, including macOS and Linux, come with <br> Python preinstalled. The version of Python that comes with <br> your operating system is called the <b> system Python.</b></p><br>

<p>The system Python is used by your operating system and is usually out of date. It’s essential that you have the <br> most recent version of Python so that you can successfully follow along <br>with the examples in this book.</p>
<img src="">

<p>You can have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer.<br> In this chapter, you’ll install the latest version of Python 3 alongside <br> any system Python that may already exist on your machine.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left;"> Note</h1>

<p>Even if you already have Python 3.9 installed, it’s still a good idea to <br>skim this chapter to double-check that your environ- ment is set up for <br>following along with this book.</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;">


<p>This chapter is split into three sections: Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu <br>Linux. Find the section for your operating system and follow the steps to get set up, then skip ahead to the next <br>chapter.</p>

<p>If you have a diﬀerent operating system, then check out Real <br></p> <p style="color: blue;">“Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide” </p> <p>to see if your OS is covered. Readers on tablets and mobile devices can refer to <br>the <p style="color: blue;"> “Online Python Interpreters” </p><p> for some browser-based options.</p>
 
	<h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 100; text-align: left;">Windows</h2><br>
<p>Follow these steps to install Python 3 and open IDLE on Windows.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left;"> Important</h1>

<p>The code in this book is tested only against Python installed as described in this section.</p><br>

<p>Be aware that if you have installed Python through some other means, such as<br> Anaconda Python, you may encounter problems when running some of the code examples.
.</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;">


<h2>Install Python</h2><br>
<p>Windows doesn’t typically come with a system Python. Fortunately, installation <br>involves little more than downloading and running the <br> Python installer from the Python.org website.</p>

<h1><b>Step 1: Download the Python 3 Installer</b></h1><br>

<p>Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL:</p><br><p style="color: blue;"><i> https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</i></p><br>
<p>Click Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.x located beneath the “Python Releases for Windows” heading near,<br> the top of the page. As of this writing, the latest version was Python 3.9.</p>

<p>Then scroll to the bottom and click Windows x86-64 executable<br> in- staller to start the download.</p>
<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left;"> Note</h1><br>

<p>If your system has a 32-bit processor, then you should choose the 32-bit installer. If you aren’t sure if your computer is <br>32-bit or 64-bit, stick with the <br>64-bit installer mentioned above</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

 
<h1><b> Step 2: Run the Installer</b></h1><br>

<p>Open your Downloads folder in Windows Explorer and double-click the file to run the installer. <br>A dialog that looks like the following one will appear:</p><br>


<img src="img/1.png"><br>


<p>It’s okay if the Python version you see is greater than 3.9.0 as <br> long as the version is not less than 3.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Important</h1><br>

<p>Make sure you select the box that says Add Python 3.x to PATH. If you install <br>Python without selecting this box, then you can run the installer again and select it</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>Click<P style="border: 1px solid black; padding: -5px -20px; width: 80px;">Install Now</P>	to install Python 3. Wait for the installation to finish,<br>
then continue to open IDLE.</p>
 
<h2><b>Open IDLE</b></h2><br>
<p>You can open IDLE in two steps:</p><br>

<p>1.	Click the Start menu and locate the Python 3.9 folder.</p><br>
<p>2.	Open the folder and select IDLE (Python 3.9).</p><br>

<p>IDLE opens a Python shell in a new window. The Python shell is an <br>interactive environment that allows you to type in Python code and <br> execute it immediately. It’s a great way to get started with Python!</p><br>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>While you’re free to use a code editor other than IDLE if you<br> prefer, note that some chapters, especially chapter 7, “Finding and<br> Fixing Code Bugs,” do contain material specific to IDLE.</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>The Python shell window looks like this:</p>

<img src="img/2.png"><br>




<p>At the top of the window, you can see the version of Python that is <br> running and some information about the operating system. If you see <br> a version less than 3.9, then you may need to revisit the installation <br> instructions in the previous section.</p>
 
<p>The >>> symbol that you see is called a <b>prompt.</b> Whenever you see<br> this, it means that Python is waiting for you to give it some instruc- tions.</p>



<p>Now that you have Python installed, let’s get straight into writing your <br>first Python program! Go ahead and move on to chapter 3.</p>



	<!---Ubuntu Linux
Follow these steps to install Python 3 and open IDLE on Ubuntu Linux.

 
Install Python
There’s a good chance that your Ubuntu distribution already has Python installed, but it probably won’t be the latest version, and it may be Python 2 instead of Python 3.

To find out what version(s) you have, open a terminal window and try the following commands:


One or more of these commands should respond with a version, as below:


Your version number may vary. If the version shown is Python 2.x or a version of Python 3 that is less than 3.9, then you want to in- stall the latest version. How you install Python on Ubuntu depends on which version of Ubuntu you’re running. You can determine your local Ubuntu version by running the following command:


Look at the version number next to Release in the console output, and follow the corresponding instructions below.
 
Ubuntu 18.04 or Greater

Ubuntu version 18.04 does not come with Python 3.9 by default, but it is in the Universe repository. You can install it with the following commands in the Terminal application:


Note that because the Universe repository is usually behind the Python release schedule, you may not get the latest version of Python
3.9. However, any version of Python 3.9 will work for this book.

Ubuntu 17 and Lower

For Ubuntu versions 17 and lower, Python 3.9 is not in the Universe repository. You need to get it from a Personal Package Archive (PPA). To install Python from the deadsnakes PPA, run the following com- mands in the Terminal application:


You can check that the correct version of Python was installed by run- ning python3 --version. If you see a version number less than 3.9, then you may need to type python3.9 --version.   Now you can open IDLE and get ready to write your first Python program.

Open IDLE
You can open IDLE from the command line by typing the following:

 
On some Linux installations, you can open IDLE with the following shortened command:

IDLE opens a Python shell in a new window. The Python shell is an interactive environment that allows you to type in Python code and execute it immediately. It’s a great way to get started with Python!


The Python shell window looks like this:




At the top of the window, you can see the version of Python that is running and some information about the operating system. If you see a version less than 3.9, then you may need to revisit the installation instructions in the previous section.
 

 

The >>> symbol that you see in the IDLE window is called a prompt. Whenever you see this, it means that Python is waiting for you to give it some instructions.


Now that you have Python installed, let’s get straight into writing your first Python program! Go ahead and move on to chapter 3.-->

<h3><b>Your First Python Program</b></h3><br>


<p>Now that you have the latest version of Python installed on your com-<br> puter, it’s time to start coding!</p>

<p><b>In this chapter, you will:</b></p>

<p>•	Write your first Python program<br>
•	Learn what happens when you run a program with an error<br>
•	Learn how to declare a variable and inspect its value<br>
•	Learn how to write comments</p><br>

<p>Ready to begin your Python journey? Let’s go!</p>

<h3><b>Write a Python Program</b></h3>
<p>If you don’t already have IDLE open, then go ahead and open it. There are two main <br
>windows that you’ll work with in IDLE: the interactive window, which is the one that <br>opens when you start IDLE, and the <b>editor window.</b></p><br>

<p>You can type code into both the interactive window and the editor win-<br> dow. The diﬀerence between the two windows is in how they execute code. In this <br
>section, you’ll learn how to execute Python code in both windows.</p><br>

<h2><b>The Interactive Window</b></h2>
<p>IDLE’s interactive window contains a Python shell, which is a tex- <br>tual user interface used to interact with the Python language. You can type a bit of <br>Python code into the interactive window and press
to immediately see the results.<br> Hence the name interactive window.</p><br>

<p>The interactive window opens automatically when you start IDLE.<br> You’ll see the following text, with some minor diﬀerences depending on your<br> setup, displayed at the top of the window:</p>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> Python 3.9.0 (tags/v3.9.0:1b293b6)<br> [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32<br>
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br>
>>>
</div>


<p>This text shows the version of Python that IDLE is running. You can also see <br>information about your operating system and some commands you can use <br>to get help and view information about Python.</p>

<p>The >>> symbol in the last line is called the prompt. This is where <br> you’ll type in your code.</p>
 
<p>Go ahead and type 1 + 1 at the prompt and press <u>Enter</u> :</p>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> >>> 1 + 1<br>
2<br>
>>>
<br>

</div>


<p>Python evaluates the expression, displays the result (2), then displays another <br>prompt. Every time you run some code in the interactive win-<br> dow, a new prompt appears directly below the result.</p>

<p>Executing Python in the interactive window can be described as a loop <br> with three steps:</p>

<p>1.	Python <b>reads</b> the code entered at the prompt.</p><br>
<p>2.	Python evaluates the code.<br>
3.	Python prints the result and waits for more input.</p><br>

<p>This loop is commonly referred to as a read-evaluate-print loop and <br> is abbreviated as REPL. Python programmers sometimes refer to the<br> Python shell as the Python REPL, or just “the REPL” for short.</p>

<p>Let’s try something a little more interesting than adding numbers. <br> A rite of passage for every programmer is writing a program that print <br> the phrase “Hello, World” on the screen.</p>

<p>At the prompt in the interactive window, type the word print followed <p> by a set of parentheses with the text <i>"Hello, World"</i> inside:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
  >>> print("Hello, World") <br>
  Hello, World

</div>

 
<p>A function is code that performs some task and can be invoked by a name.<br> The above code invokes, or calls, the print() function with<br> the text "Hello, World" as input.</p>

<p>The parentheses tell Python to call the print() function. They also en- <br> close everything that gets sent to the function as input. The quotation marks <br> indicate that "Hello, World" really is text and not something else.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>IDLE highlights parts of your code in diﬀerent colors as you<br> type to make it easier for you to identify the diﬀerent parts.<br>

By default, functions are highlighted in purple and<br> text is high- lighted in green.
</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>The interactive window executes a single line of code at a time.<br> This is useful for trying out small code examples and exploring the Python language,<br> but it has a major limitation: you have to enter your code one line at a time!</p><br>

<p>Alternatively, you can save Python code in a text file and execute all of the code <br>in the file to run an entire program.</p>

<h2><b>The Editor Window</b></h2><br>
<p>You’ll write your Python files using IDLE’s editor window. You can</p><br>
 
<p>open the editor window by selecting the top of the interactive window.<br>
 
from the menu at</p><br>
 

<p>The interactive window stays open when you open the editor window.<br> It displays the output generated by code in the editor<br> window, so you’ll want to arrange the two windows <br> so that you can see them both at the same time.</p><br>
 
<p>In the editor window, type in the same code you used to print <u>"Hello, World"</u> in the interactive window:</p><br>

<p>IDLE highlights code typed into the editor window just like in the in-<br> teractive window.</p><br>


<p>Before you run your program, you need to save it. Select from the menu and save the file as <i>hello_world.py. </i></p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>On some systems, the default directory for saving files in <br>IDLE is the Python installation directory. Do not save your files to this directory. Instead, save them to your desktop or to a folder in your <br>user’s home directory

<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>The <i>.py,</i> extension indicates that a file contains Python code.<br> In fact, saving your file with any other extension removes the code highlight-<br> ing. IDLE only highlights Python code when it’s stored in a .py file.</p>

<h3>Running Python Programs in the Editor Window</h3><br>

 
<p>To run your program, select <u><i>Run</i></u> editor window.</p>
 
<p>from the menu in the</p>
 

 <h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>Pressing F5 also runs a program from the editor window.
</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>Program output always appears in the interactive window.</p>
 
<p>Every time you run code from a file, you’ll see something like the fol-<br> lowing output in the interactive window:</p>

<p>=======================RESTART============</p><br>
<p>IDLE restarts the Python interpreter, which is the computer program that actually<br> executes your code, every time you run a file. This makes sure that programs are <br> executed the same way each time.</p>

 
<h2><b>Opening Python Files in the Editor Window</b></h2>

<p>To open an existing file in IDLE, select
 from the menu,<br>
 
then select the file you want to open. IDLE opens every file in<br> a new editor window, so you can have several files open at the same time.</p>

<p>You can also open a file from a file manager, such as Windows Explorer<br> or macOS Finder. Right-click the file icon and select<br>
to open the file in IDLE’s editor window.</p>

<p>Double-clicking on a .py file from a file manager executes the pro-<br> gram.   However, this usually runs the file with the system Python, and the program window disappears <br>immediately after the program terminates—often before you can even see any output.</p>

<p>For now, the best way to run your Python programs is to open them <br> in IDLE’s editor window and run them from there.</p>


	<h2><b>Mess Things Up</b></h2>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes—especially while programming! In case you haven’t made any<br> mistakes yet, let’s get a head start and mess something up on purpose to see what happens.</p>

<p>Mistakes in programs are called <b> errors.</b> You’ll experience two main types of<br> errors: syntax errors and runtime errors.</p>
 
<h3>Syntax Errors</h3>
<p>A syntax error occurs when you write code that isn’t allowed <br> in the Python language.</p>

<p>Let’s create a syntax error by removing the last quotation mark from the code in the <br>hello_world.py file that you created in the last section:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
  print("Hello, World)
</div><br>
<p>Save the file and press F5	to run it. The code won’t run! IDLE dis-<br>
plays an alert box with the following message:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
 EOL while scanning string literal.
</div><br>

<p>There are two terms in this message that may be unfamiliar:</p>

<p>1.	A string literal is text enclosed in quotation  marks. "Hello, World" is a string literal.</p><br>
<p>2.	EOL stands for end of line.</p><br>

<p>So, the message tells you that Python got to the end of a line while reading a string <br>literal. String literals must be terminated with a quo- <br>tation mark before the end of a line.</p>

<p>IDLE highlights the line containing print("Hello, World) in red to help you quickly find the line of <br>code with the syntax error. Without the second quotation mark, everything after the<br> first quotation mark— including the closing parenthesis—is part of a string literal.</p>

<h2><b>Runtime Errors</b></h2>
<p>IDLE catches syntax errors before a program starts running. In con-<br> trast, runtime errors only occur while a program is running.</p>

<p>To generate a runtime error, remove both quotation marks in the<br>
<i>hello_world.py </i>file:</p>
 
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
  print("Hello, World)
</div><br>
 

<p>Did you notice how the text color changed to black when you removed the quotation marks?<br> IDLE no longer recognizes Hello, World as text.
What do you think <br> will happen when you run the program? Press to find out!</p>

<p>The following text displays in red in the interactive window:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/hello_world.py", line 1, in <module> print(Hello, World)
NameError: name 'Hello' is not defined

</div><br>

<p>Whenever an error occurs, Python stops executing the program and displays several <br>lines of text called a traceback. The traceback<br> shows useful information about the error.</p><br>

<p>Tracebacks are best read from the bottom up:</p>

<p>•	The last line of the traceback tells you the name of the error and the error message.<br> In this case, a NameError occurred because<br> the name Hello is not defined anywhere.</p><br>
<p>•	The second to last line shows you the code that produced the error. There’s only one<br> line of code in <i>hello_world.py,</i> so it’s <br>not hard to guess where the problem is. This information is more helpful for larger files.</p><br>
<p>•	The third to last line tells you the name of the file and the line num-<br> ber so you can go to the exact spot in your code where the error occurred.</p><br>

<p>In the next section, you’ll see how to define names for values in your code.<br> Before you move on, though, you can get some practice with syntax errors <br> and runtime errors by working on the review exercises.</p>
 
<h3><b>Review Exercises</b></h3>
<p>You can пnd the solutions to these exercises and many other bonus resources<br> online at <i style="color: blue;">realpython.com/python-basics/resources</i></p>
<br>
<p>1.	Write a program that IDLE won’t run because it has a syntax error.</p>
<p>2.	Write a program that crashes only while it’s running because it has a runtime error.</p>


<h2><b>	Create a Variable</b></h2>
<p>In Python, variables are names that can be assigned a value and then used to <br> refer to that value throughout your code.</p><br>

<p>Variables are fundamental to programming for two reasons:</p><br>

<p>1.<b>	Variables keep values accessible:</b> For example, you can as-<br> sign the result of some time-consuming operation to a variable so that your program doesn’t have to perform the <br>operation each time you need to use the result.</p>
<p>2.	<b>Variables give values context:</b> The number 28 could mean lots of diﬀerent things, such as the number <br> of students in a class, the number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. Giving the value 28 a name like num_students <br> makes the meaning of the value clear.</p>

<p>In this section, you’ll learn how to use variables in your code, as well as some <br> of the conventions Python programmers follow when choosing names for variables.</p>

<h2><b>The Assignment Operator</b></h2>
<p>An operator is a symbol, such as +, that performs an operation on one<br> or more values. For example, the + operator takes two numbers, one to the left of the <br>operator and one to the right, and adds them together.</p><br>
 
<p>Values are assigned to variable names using a special symbol called <br> the <b> assignment operator </b>(=) . The = operator takes the value to the right <br>of the operator and assigns it to the name on the left.</p><br>

<p>Let’s modify the<i> hello_world.py</i> file from the previous section to assign some <br>text in a variable before printing it to the screen:</p><br>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
>>> greeting = "Hello, World"
>>> print(greeting) 
Hello, world


</div><br>

<p>On the first line, you create a variable named greeting and assign <br> it the value "Hello, World" using the = operator.</p>

<p>print(greeting) displays the output Hello, World because Python looks for the name<br> greeting, finds that it’s been assigned the value "Hello, World", and replaces the <br>variable name with its value before calling the function.</p>

<p>If you hadn’t executed greeting = "Hello, World" before executing <br>print(greeting), then you would have seen a NameError like you did when you tried to execute <br> print(Hello, World) in the previous section.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>Although = looks like the equals sign from mathematics, it has a diﬀerent meaning in <br>Python. This distinction is important and can be a source of frustration for beginner <br>programmers.<br>

Just remember, whenever you see the = operator, whatever is to the right of it is being assigned to a variable on the left<br>

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>


<p>Variable names are case sensitive, so a variable named greeting is  <br> not the same as a variable named Greeting. <br>For instance, the following code produces a NameError:</p>
 
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
>>> greeting = "Hello, World"
>>> print(Greeting)
Traceback (most recent call last): File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'Greeting' is not defined



</div><br>
 

<p>If you have trouble with an example in this book, double-check that every character in <br>your code—including spaces—matches the example exactly. Computers have no common sense, <br>so being almost correct isn’t good enough!</p>

<h2><b>Rules for Valid Variable Names</b></h2>
<p>Variable names can be as long or as short as you like, but there are a few rules that you must follow.<br> Variable names may contain upper- case and lowercase letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and <br> underscores (_), but they cannot begin with a digit.</p>

<p>For example, each of the following is a valid Python variable name:</p><br>

<p>•	string1<br>
•	_a1p4a<br>
•	list_of_names</p>

<p>The following aren’t valid variable names because they start with a digit:</p><br>

<P>•	9lives<br>
•	99_balloons<br>
•	2beOrNot2Be<br>
</P>
<p>In addition to English letters and digits, Python variable names may contain many diﬀerent valid Unicode characters.</p><br>

<p>Unicode is a standard for digitally representing characters used in most of the world’s writing systems. That means variable names can contain letters from non-English alphabets, such as decorated letters</p><br>
 
<p>like é and ü, and even Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic symbols.</p><br>

<p>However, not every system can display decorated characters, so it’s a good idea to avoid them if you’re going to share your code with people in diﬀerent regions.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>You’ll learn more about Unicode in chapter 12.

You can also read about Python’s support for Unicode in the oﬃcial Python documentation.
<br>

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>


<p>Just because a variable name is valid doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good name</p>.

<p>Choosing a good name for a variable can be surprisingly diﬃcult. For- tunately, there are some guidelines that you can follow to help you choose better names.</p>

<h3><b>Descriptive Names Are Better Than Short Names</b></h3>
<p>Descriptive variable names are essential, especially for complex programs. Writing descriptive names often requires using multiple words. Don’t be afraid to use long variable names.</p><br>

<p>In the following example, the value 3600 is assigned to the variable s:</p><br>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
s = 3600


</div><br>
 

<p>The name s is totally ambiguous. Using a full word makes it a lot easier to understand what the code means:</p>
 
 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

seconds = 3600

</div><br>
 
<p>seconds is a better name than s because it provides more context. But it still doesn’t convey the full meaning of the code. Is 3600 the number of seconds it takes for a process to finish, or is it the length of a movie? There’s no way to tell.</p><br>

<p>The following name leaves no doubt about what the code means:</p>


<p>When you read the above code, there’s no question that 3600 is the number of seconds in an hour. seconds_per_hour takes longer to type than both the single letter s and the word seconds, but the payoﬀ in clarity is massive.</p><br>

<p>Although naming variables descriptively means using longer variable names, you should avoid using excessively long names. A good rule of thumb is to limit variable names to three or four words maximum.</p>

<h3><b>Python Variable Naming Conventions</b></h3><br>
<p>In many programming languages, it’s common to write variable names in mixedCase. In this system, you capitalize the first letter of every word except the first and leave all other letters in lowercase. For example, numStudents and listOfNames are written in mixedCase.</p><br>

<p>In Python, however, it’s more common to write variable names in lower_case_with_underscores. In this system, you leave every letter in lowercase and separate each word with an underscore. For instance, both num_students and list_of_names are written using the lower_case_with_underscores system.</p>

<p>There’s no rule mandating that you write your variable names in lower_case_with_underscores. The practice is codified, though, in a document called PEP 8, which is widely regarded as the oﬃcial style guide for writing Python.</p>
 

 <h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. A PEP is a de- sign document used by the Python community to propose new features to the language

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>Following the standards outlined in PEP 8 ensures that your Python code is readable by most Python programmers. This makes sharing code and collaborating with other people easier for everyone involved.</p>

<h2><b>Review Exercises</b></h2><br>
<p>You can пnd the solutions to these exercises and many other bonus resources online at<i> realpython.com/python-basics/resources</i></p><br>

<p>1.	Using the interactive window, display some text using print().<br>
2.	Using the interactive window, assign a string literal to a variable. Then print the contents of the variable using the print() function.<br>
3.	Repeat the first two exercises using the editor window.</p>


	<h2><b>Inspect Values in the Interactive Window</b></h2>
<p>Type the following into IDLE’s interactive window:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> greeting = "Hello, World"
>>> greeting
'Hello, World'


</div><br>
 

<p>When you press	after typing greeting a second time, Python
prints the string literal assigned to greeting even though you didn’t use the print() function. This is called variable inspection.</p>
 
<p>Now print the string assigned to greeting using the print() function:</p><br>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> print(greeting) 
Hello, World

</div><br>



<p>Can you spot the diﬀerence between the output displayed by using print() and the output displayed by just entering the variable name and pressing Enter ?</p><br>
<p>When you type the variable name greeting and press Enter , Python prints the value assigned to the variable as it appears in your code. You assigned the string literal "Hello, World" to greeting, which is why <i>'Hello, World' <i> is displayed with quotation marks.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>String literals can be created with single or double quotation marks in Python. At Real Python, we use double quotes wher- ever possible, whereas IDLE output appears in single quotes by default.

Both "Hello, World" and 'Hello, World' mean the same thing in Python—what’s most important is that you be consistent in your usage. You’ll learn more about strings in chapter 4

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>
<p>On the other hand, print() displays a more human-readable represen- tation of the variable’s value which, for string literals, means display- ing the text without quotation marks.</p>

<p>Sometimes, both printing and inspecting a variable produce the same output:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> x = 2
>>> x 2
>>> print(x)
2


</div><br>
 
 
<p>Here, you assign the number 2 to x. Both using print(x) and inspecting x display output without quotation marks because 2 is a number and not text. In most cases, though, variable inspection gives you more useful information than print().</p><br.>

<p>Suppose you have two variables: x, which is assigned the number 2, and y, which is assigned the string literal "2". In this case, print(x) and print(y) both display the same thing:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> x = 2
>>> y = "2"
>>> print(x) 2
>>> print(y)
2


</div><br>
 


<p>However, inspecting x and y shows the diﬀerence between each vari- able’s value:</p>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> x 2
>>> y
'2'


</div><br>



<p>The key takeaway here is that print() displays a readable representa- tion of a variable’s value, while variable inspection displays the value as it appears in the code.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that variable inspection works only in the interactive window. For example, try running the following program from the editor window:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

greeting = "Hello, World" 
greeting

</div><br>
 

<P>The program executes without any errors, but it doesn’t display any output!</P>
 
	
<h3><b>How to Write a Comment</b></h3><br>
<p>The most common way to write a comment is to begin a new line in your code with the # character. When you run your code, Python ig- nores lines starting with #.</p><br>

<p>Comments that start on a new line are called block comments. You can also write inline comments, which are comments that appear on the same line as the code they reference. Just put a # at the end of the line of code, followed by the text in your comment.
</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a program with both kinds of comments:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

 # This is a block comment.
greeting = "Hello, World"
print(greeting) # This is an inline comment


</div><br>
 
<p>Of course, you can still use the # symbol inside a string. For instance, Python won’t mistake the following for the start of a comment:</p>
 
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

>>> print("#1")
#1


</div><br>

<p>In general, it’s a good idea to keep comments as short as possible, but sometimes you need to write more than reasonably fits on a single line. In that case, you can continue your comment on a new line that also begins with the # symbol:</p><br>


<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

# This is my first program.
# It prints the phrase "Hello, World"
# The comments are longer than the code! greeting = "Hello, World" print(greeting)


</div><br>

 <p>You can also use comments to comment out code while you’re test- ing a program. Putting a # at the beginning of a line of code lets you run your program as if that line of code didn’t exist, but it doesn’t ac- tually delete the code.</p>

<p>To comment out a section of code in IDLE, highlight one or more lines to be commented and press:</p>
<p>•	Windows:Alt	+ 3<br>
•	macOS:Ctrl + 3<br>
•	Ubuntu Linux:Ctrl	+ D<br>
</p><br>                
<p>To remove comments, highlight the commented lines and press:</p>

<p>•	Windows: Alt + 4<br>
•	macOS: Ctrl	+ 4<br>
•	Ubuntu Linux: Ctrl +Shift + D<br>
</p>
<p>Now let’s look at some common conventions for code comments.</p>


<h2><b>Conventions and Pet Peeves</b></h2><br>
<p>According to PEP 8, comments should always be written in complete sentences with a single space between the # and the first word of the comment:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

# This comment is formatted to PEP 8.


#this one isn't



</div><br>

<p>For inline comments, PEP 8 recommends at least two spaces between<br>
 
the code and the # symbol:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 

phrase = "Hello, World" # This comment is PEP 8 compliant.
print(phrase)# This comment isn't.
</div><br>

<p>PEP 8 recommends that comments be used sparingly. A major pet peeve among programmers is comments that describe what is already obvious from reading the code.</p>
<br>
<p>For example, the comment in the following code is unnecessary:</p>
 
 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
# Print "Hello, World"
print("Hello, World")
.</i>
</div><br>

<p>The comment is unnecessary because the code itself explicitly de- scribes what’s happening.   Comments are best used to clarify code that may be diﬃcult to understand or to explain why something is coded a certain way.</p>

<h3><b>Strings and String Methods</b></h3><br>


<p>Many programmers, regardless of their specialty, deal with text on a daily basis. For example, web developers work with text input from web forms. Data scientists process text to extract data and perform tasks like sentiment analysis, which can help identify and classify opinions in a body of text.</p>

<p>Collections of text in Python are called strings. Special functions <br> called string methods are used to manipulate strings. There are string methods for changing a string from lowercase to uppercase, re-<br> moving whitespace from the beginning or end of a string, replacing parts of a string with diﬀerent text, and much more.</p>

<h2><b>In this chapter, you’ll learn how to:</b></h2>

<p>•	Manipulate strings with string methods<br>
•	Work with user input<br>
•	Deal with strings of numbers<br>
•	Format strings for printing <br> Let’s get started!

</p>

   <h2><b>What Is a String?</b></h2>
<p>In chapter 3, you created the string "Hello, World" and printed it in IDLE’s interactive window using print(). In this section, you’ll get a deeper look into exactly what strings are and the various ways you can create them in Python.</p>

<h2><b>The String Data Type</b></h2>
<P>Strings are one of the fundamental Python data types. The term data type refers to what kind of data a value represents. Strings are used  to represent text.</P>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>There are several other data types built into Python. For exam- ple, you’ll learn about numerical data types in chapter 5 and Boolean data types in chapter 8.</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>


<P>We say that strings are a fundamental data type because they can’t be broken down into smaller values of a diﬀerent type. <br> Not all data types are fundamental. You’ll learn about compound data types, also known as data structures, in chapter 9.</P><br>

<p>The string data type has a special abbreviated name in Python: str. You can see this by using type(), which is a function used to determine the data type of a given value.</p>

<p>Type the following into IDLE’s interactive window:</p><br>

 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> type("Hello, World")
class 'str'>

</i>
</div><br>

<p>The output class 'str'> indicates that the value "Hello, World" is an instance of the str data type. That is, "Hello, World" is a string.</p><br>
 
<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>TFor now, you can think of the word class as a synonym for data type, although it actually refers to something more specific. You’ll see just what a class is in chapter 10</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

 

<p>type() also works for values that have been assigned to a variable:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> phrase = "Hello, World"
>>> type(phrase)
class 'str'>

</i>
</div><br>


<p>Strings have three important properties:</p>

<p>1.	Strings contain individual letters or symbols called characters.<br>
2.	Strings have a length, defined as the number of characters the string contains.<br>
3.	Characters in a string appear in a sequence, which means that each character has a numbered position in the string.<br>

Let’s take a closer look at how strings are created.</p>


<h2><b>String Literals</b></h2>
<p>As you’ve already seen, you can create a string by surrounding some text with quotation marks:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
string1 = 'Hello, World' 
 string2 = "1234"

</i>
</div><br>

<p>You can use either single quotes (string1) or double quotes (string2) to create a string as long as you use the same type at the beginning and end of the string.</p><br>

<p>Whenever you create a string by surrounding text with quotation marks, the string is called a string literal. <br> The name indicates that the string is literally written out in your code. All the strings you’ve seen thus far are string literals.</p>
 
<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>Not every string is a string literal. Sometimes strings are input by a user or read from a file. Since they’re not typed out with quotation marks in your code, they’re not string literals.</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

 <p>The quotes surrounding a string are called delimiters because they tell Python where a string begins and where it ends. When one type of quotes is used as the delimiter, the other type can be used inside the string:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
string3 = "We're #1!"
string4 = 'I said, "Put it over by the llama."'


</i>
</div><br>

<p>After Python reads the first delimiter, it considers all the characters after it part of the string until it reaches a second matching delimiter. <br>This is why you can use a single quote in a string delimited by double quotes, and vice versa.</p>

<p>If you try to use double quotes inside a string delimited by double quotes, you’ll get an error:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> text = "She said, "What time is it?""
File "stdin", line 1
text = "She said, "What time is it?""
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


</i>
</div><br>

<p>Python throws a SyntaxError because it thinks the string ends after the second ", and it doesn’t know how to interpret the rest of the line. If you need to <br>include a quotation mark that matches the delimiter in- side a string, then you can escape the character using a backslash:</p><br>

 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> text = "She said, \"What time is it?\""
>>> print(text)
She said, "What time is it?"

</i>
</div><br>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>When you work on a project, it’s a good idea to use only single quotes or only double quotes to delimit every string.<br>

Keep in mind that there really isn’t a right or wrong choice! The goal is to be consistent because consistency helps make your code easier to read and understand.
</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br> 

<p>Strings can contain any valid Unicode character. For example, the string "We're #1!" contains the pound sign (#) and "1234" contains num- bers. "×Pýŧħøŋ×" is also a valid Python string!</p>

<h2><b>Determine the Length of a String</b></h2>
<p>The number of characters contained in a string, including spaces, is called the length of the string. For example, the string "abc" has a length of 3, and the string "Don't Panic" has a length of 11.</p><br>

<p>Python has a built-in len() function that you can use to determine the length of a string. To see how it works, type the following into IDLE’s interactive window:</p><br>


 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> len("abc") 
3

</i>
</div><br>

<P>You can also use len() to get the length of a string that’s assigned to a variable:</P>
<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px;"> 
<i>
>>> letters = "abc"
>>> len(letters)
 3

</i>
</div><br>

<p>First, you assign the string "abc" to the variable letters. Then you use<br>
len() to get the length of letters, which is 3.</p>
 
<h2><b>Multiline Strings </b></h2><br>
<p>The PEP 8 style guide recommends that each line of Python code con- tain no more than seventy-nine characters—including spaces.</p>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>PEP 8’s seventy-nine-character line length is a recommenda- tion, not a rule. Some Python programmers prefer a slightly longer line length.<br>

In this book, we’ll strictly follow PEP 8’s recommended line length.

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p>Whether you follow PEP 8 or choose a longer line length, sometimes you’ll need to create string literals with more characters than your cho- sen limit.</p><br>

<p>To deal with long strings, you can break them up across multiple lines into multiline strings. For example, suppose you need to fit the following text into a string literal:</p><br>


<p style="text-align: center;">This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy<br> for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely con- cerned with the <br>movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn’t <br> the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.<i>
— Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</i></p>


<p>This paragraph contains far more than seventy-nine characters, so any line of code containing the paragraph as a string <br>literal violates PEP 8. So, what do you do?</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to tackle this. One way is to break the string up across multiple lines and put a backslash (\) at the end of all but the</p><br>
 
<p>last line. To be PEP 8 compliant, the total length of the line, including the backslashes, must be seventy-nine characters or fewer.</p>

<p>Here’s how you could write the paragraph as a multiline string using the backslash method:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

paragraph = "This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was \ this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much \ of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but \ most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small \ green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't \ the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."

</div><br>



<p>Notice that you don’t have to close each line with a quotation mark. Normally, Python would get to the end <br> of the first line and complain that you didn’t close the string with a matching double quote. With a backslash at the end, <br> you can keep writing the same string on the next line.</p>

<p>When you print() a multiline string that’s broken up by backslashes, the output is displayed on a single line:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> long_string = "This multiline string is \ displayed on one line"
>>> print(long_string)
This multiline string is displayed on one line

</div><br>



<p>You can also create multiline strings using triple quotes (""" or ''') as delimiters. Here’s how to write a long paragraph using this approach:</p>

 <div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

paragraph = """This planet has—or rather had—a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."""

</div><br>


<p>Triple-quoted strings preserve whitespace, including newlines. This means that running print(paragraph) would <br> display the string on mul- tiple lines, just as it appears in the string literal. This may or may not be what you want, so you’ll need to<br> think about the desired output before you choose how to write a multiline string.</p>

<p>To see how whitespace is preserved in a triple-quoted string, type the following into IDLE’s interactive window:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> print("""An example of a
... string that spans across multiple lines
... and also preserves whitespace.""")
An example of a
string that spans across multiple lines
and also preserves whitespace.


</div><br>

<p>Notice how the second and third lines in the output are indented in exactly the same way as the string literal.</p>



	<h2><b>Concatenation, Indexing, and Slicing</b></h2><br>
<p>Now that you know what a string is and how to declare string literals in your code, let’s explore some of the things you can do with strings.<br>
In this section, you’ll learn about three basic string operations:</p>

<p>1.	Concatenation, which joins two strings together<br>
2.	Indexing, which gets a single character from a string<br>
3.	Slicing, which gets several characters from a string at once <br> Let’s dive in!</p><br>
<h3><b>String Concatenation</b></h3>
<p>You can combine, or concatenate, two strings using the + operator:</p>


<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> string1 = "abra"
>>> string2 = "cadabra"
>>> magic_string = string1 + string2
>>> magic_string
'abracadabra'
</div><br>

<p>In this example, the string concatenation occurs on the third line. You concatenate string1 and string2 using +, and then you<br> assign the re- sult to the variable magic_string. Notice that the two <br> strings are joined without any whitespace between them.</p><br>


<p>You can use string concatenation to join two related strings, such as joining a <br> first name and a last name into a full name:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> first_name = "Arthur"
>>> last_name = "Dent"
>>> full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
>>> full_name
'Arthur Dent'

</div><br>

<p>Here, you use string concatenation twice on the same line. First, you concatenate first_name with " " to ensure a space <br> appears after the first name in the final string. This produces the string "Arthur ", which you <br> then concatenate with last_name to produce the full name "Arthur Dent".</p>
 
<h3><b>String Indexing</b></h3><br>
<p>Each character in a string has a numbered position called an index. You can access the character at the nth position by <br>putting the number n between two square brackets ([]) immediately after the string:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> flavor = "fig pie"
>>> flavor[1]
'i'


</div><br>

<p>flavor[1] returns the character at position 1 in "fig pie", which is i. Wait. Isn’t f the first character of "fig pie"?<br>
In Python—and in most other programming languages—counting al- ways starts at zero. To get the character <br> at the beginning of a string, you need to access the character at position 0:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #fff;"> 

>>> flavor[0]
'f'



</div><br>

<h1 style="background-color: #333; text-align: left; color: #fff;">Note</h1><br>

<p>Forgetting that counting starts with zero and trying to access the first character in a string with the index 1 results in an oп- by-one error.<br>

Oﬀ-by-one errors are a common source of frustration for begin- ning and experienced programmers alike!

</p>
<hr style="color: black; height: 3px;"><br>

<p> The following figure shows the index for each character of the string
"fig pie":</p>
<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">
<p>|	f	|	i	|	g	|		|	p	|	i	|	e	|</p>
 <p>0		1		2		3		4		5			6 </p>
<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">

<p>If you try to access an index beyond the end of a string, then Python raises an IndexError:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

>>> flavor[9]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "pyshell#4>", line 1, in module>
flavor[9]
IndexError: string index out of range

</div><br>

<p>The largest index in a string is always one less than the string’s length. Since "fig pie" has a length of seven, the largest index allowed is 6.</p><br>

<p>Strings also support negative indices:</p>


<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

>>> flavor[-1]
'e'


</div><br>


<p>The last character in a string has index -1, which for "fig pie" is the letter e. The second to last character i has index -2, and so on.</p><br>

<p>The following figure shows the negative index for each character in the string "fig pie":</p>
<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">


<p> |	f	|	i	|	g	|	|	p	|	i	|	e	| </p>
<p>  -7	-6	-5	-4	-3	-2	-1   </p>

<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">


<p>Just like with positive indices, Python raises an IndexError if you try to access a negative index less than the index of the first character in the string:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

>>> flavor[-10]
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "pyshell#5", line 1, in module
flavor[-10]
IndexError: string index out of range
</div><br>

<p>Negative indices may not seem useful at first, but sometimes they’re a better choice than a positive index.</p><br>
 
 <p>For example, suppose a string input by a user is assigned to the vari- able user_input. If you need to get the last character of the string, how do you know what index to use?</p>

<p>One way to get the last character of a string is to calculate the final index using len():</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

final_index = len(user_input) - 1 last_character = user_input[final_index]
</div><br>

<p>Getting the final character with the index -1 takes less typing and doesn’t require an intermediate step to calculate the final index:
</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

last_character = user_input[-1]
</div><br>
<h3><b>String Slicing</b></h3>
<p>Suppose you need a string containing just the first three letters of the string "fig pie". You could access each character by index and con- catenate them like this:</p>


<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

>>> first_three_letters = flavor[0] + flavor[1] + flavor[2]
>>> first_three_letters
'fig'

</div><br> 

<p>If you need more than just the first few letters of a string, then get-<br> ting each character individually and concatenating them together is clumsy and long-winded.<br> Fortunately, Python provides a way to do this with much less typing.</p>

<p>You can extract a portion of a string, called a substring, by inserting a <br> colon between two index numbers set inside square brackets like this:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 400px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;
  padding: 50px; margin: 20px; color: #333;"> 

>>> flavor = "fig pie"
>>> flavor[0:3]
'fig'

</div><br> 
 
<p>flavor[0:3] returns the first three characters of the string assigned to flavor, starting with the character at index 0 and going up to but not in-</br> cluding the character at index 3. The [0:3] part of flavor[0:3] is called a slice. In this case, it returns a slice of "fig pie". Yum!</p>

<p>String slices can be confusing because the substring returned by the slice includes the character whose index <br> is the first number but doesn’t include the character whose index is the second number.</p>

<p>To remember how slicing works, you can think of a string as a se- quence of square slots. The left and right boundaries of <br>each slot are numbered sequentially from zero up to the length of the string, <br> and each slot is filled with a character in the string.</p>

<p>Here’s what this looks like for the string "fig pie":</p>
<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">


<p> |	f	|	i	|	g	|	|	p	|	i	|	e	| </p> 
<p>   0		1		2		3	4		5		6			7</p>

<hr style="color: black; width: 10%; margin-left: 0%;">


<p>So, for "fig pie", the slice [0:3] returns the string "fig", and the slice
[3:7] returns the string " pie".</p>

<p>If you omit the first index in a sli ce, then Python assumes you want to start at index 0:</p>

<p>The slice [:3] is equivalent to the slice [0:3], so flavor[:3] returns the first three characters in the string "fig pie".</p>
